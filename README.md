# Giant Bomb Podcast Website
A website that displays lists of [The Bombcast](http://www.giantbomb.com/podcasts/) and [The Giant Beastcast](http://www.giantbomb.com/podcasts/beastcast/).

A python script runs automatically when new episodes of the podcasts come out. It
fetches the rss feed from www.giantbomb.com/feeds and parses the relevant data into
a .json file that this website uses to display the lists of the podcasts.
